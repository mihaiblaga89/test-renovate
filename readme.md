### Observed behaviour
There's only one PR for the last group match, `rnv canary packages`. 

Current RNV packages versions

alpha: 0.35.2-alpha.1         
canary: 0.37.3-rc.1           
feat: 0.37.2-feat-security.3  
latest: 0.37.3

### Expected behaviour
There should be 2 PRs, one for `rnv canary packages` and one for `rnv stable packages`
